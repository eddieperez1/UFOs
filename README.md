# UFOs


## Overview of Project:
### Requirements
This project uses javascript, html, and css. Visual Studio Code is the IDE used to write in all the language in this project.

### Purpose
Dana, a client wants to create a website about UFOs and their sightings. Given a dataset of UFO sightings in [data.js](/static/js/data.js), a website was created using [app1.js](/static/js/app1.js) and previous version of [index.html](/index.html). The goal is to create an UI to filter the UFO data.

## Results: 

### Usage
To use this website, open index.html in a browser. The default page has a title, image of Earth from nasa, a subtitle and paragraph introducing the topic, and a filter search and table with UFO sighting data. The filter search can be changed by typing in filter criteria and pressing enter. This changes the data shown in the table.

#### The default page

#### The page after filter criteria has been entered. For example, date: 1/09/2010, shape: light
![page after filter criteria](/screenshots/screenshot_of_using_filters_on_webpage.PNG)

## Summary:

### Further Developments to Website
One of the drawbacks to the website is the user needs to know to press enter to use the filter search. It is better to have a button to clearly communicate to the user what needs to be done to filter data. The table can be put into scroll box so the data doesn't fill the whole website. If the dataset was much larger, this would be quite a problem.
